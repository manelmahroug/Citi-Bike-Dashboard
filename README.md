# Citi-Bike-Dashboard

Background:

Congratulations on the new job! As the new lead analyst for the New York Citi Bike Program, I am now responsible for overseeing the largest bike sharing program in the United States. In my new role, I will be expected to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program.

Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage.

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have a number of questions on the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.

Objective:

The task in this assignment is to aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs to build a data dashboard, story, or report. Choose a time-span with thorough data. Merge multiple datasets if necessary from different periods. Try to provide answers to the following questions:

1.How many trips have been recorded total during the chosen period?

2.By what percentage has total ridership grown?

3.How has the proportion of short-term customers and annual subscribers changed?

4.What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during summer months?

5.What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during winter months?

6.What are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why do you hypothesize these are the top locations?)

7.What are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? (Based on data, why?)

8.What are the bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why?)

9.What are the bottom 10 stations in the city for ending a journey (Based on data, why?)

10.What is the gender breakdown of active participants (Male v. Female)?

11.How effective has gender outreach been in increasing female ridership over the course of the past three years?

12.How does the average trip duration change by age?

13.What is the average distance in miles that a bike is ridden?

14.Which Bikes (by ID) are most likely due for repair or inspection this year?

15.How variable is the utilization by bike ID?

  Additionally, city officials would like to see the following visualizations:

-A static map that plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey with zip code data overlaid on top.

-A dynamic map that shows how each station's popularity changes over time (by month and year) -- with commentary pointing to any interesting events that may be behind these phenomena.

Considerations
Remember, the people reading the analysis will NOT be data analysts. The audience will be city officials, public administrators, and heads of New York City departments. The data and analysis needs to be presented in a way that is focused, concise, easy-to-understand, and visually compelling. Your visualizations should be colorful enough to be included in press releases, and the analysis should be thoughtful enough for dictating programmatic changes.
